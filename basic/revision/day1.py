# Code (code file) ---------> Byte Code (mostly hidden) --------------> Python VM (virtual machine) 

# Byte code is not a machine code is directly 
# Byte code is a python specific interpretation code 

# Python internally works at a lower level (bytecode + PVM) 
# Python externally is high-level ,simple, and developer-friendly 

# so the python is a High-Level Programming language . 

# There are datatypes 

# mutable :- List, set , dictionary, bytearray, array
# Immutable :- Integer, float , Boolean, String, Tuples Frozen Set, Byte 

# user_name = "sameer"
# user_name = "rohit"


# print(user_name) # rohit change the reference value can't be change . 

# x = 10 
# y = x 

# x = 15

# # here change the reference  

# print(x) # 15
# print(y) # 10


# m = [1,2,3]
# n = m

# in this case i change the element of list 
# m[0] = 55

# # in this case i change the list all over 
# m = [55]

# print(m)
# print(n)
